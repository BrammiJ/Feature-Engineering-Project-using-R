# Feature-Engineering-Project-using-R
Performed Feature Engineering using R on London Airbnb Dataset

The project was submitted as a solution to one of my coursework challenges- 2023-24 CST4070 Applied Data Analytics - Tools, Practical Big Data Handling, Cloud Distribution

### Project Overview:
The following steps were undertaken as part of this project:

**1. Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to gain insights into the features and their relationships. Are there any missing values, outliers, or data quality issues that need to be addressed? \
**2. Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset, handle missing values (if necessary), and encode categorical variables (if necessary). \
**3. Feature Engineering:** Create a feature engineering model designed to predict rental revenue using the given features. Formulate your features based on specific
hypotheses, incorporating initial speculative ideas.
